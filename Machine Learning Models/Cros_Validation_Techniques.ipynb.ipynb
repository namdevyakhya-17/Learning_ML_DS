    "\n",
    "#### 🔺 Higher Value of `k`\n",
    "- More reliable performance estimate\n",
    "- Model is trained **k times** → higher computation cost\n",
    "- Training sets are larger and very similar\n",
    "- Can increase variance if folds are not well-represented\n",

    "Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation is a variation of standard K-Fold Cross-Validation designed specifically for **classification problems**, especially when the dataset is **imbalanced**.  \n",
    "Its main objective is to ensure that **each fold preserves the same class distribution** as the original dataset.\n",
    "Each fold contains approximately the same proportion of samples from each target class as found in the full dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Stratified K-Fold Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Stratification**\n",
    "   - The dataset is first grouped based on the target variable (class labels).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Proportional Distribution**\n",
    "   - Samples from each class are distributed evenly across all `k` folds.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     - Original dataset: 80% Class A, 20% Class B  \n",
    "     - Each fold: approximately 80% Class A and 20% Class B\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iterative Evaluation**\n",
    "   - The process runs for `k` iterations:\n",
    "     - One fold is used as the validation (test) set.\n",
    "     - The remaining `k−1` folds are combined to form the training set.\n",
    "   - Both training and validation sets maintain the original class proportions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Performance Averaging**\n",
    "   - Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.) are recorded for each iteration.\n",
    "   - Final performance is computed as the **average across all folds**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Stratified K-Fold Is Important\n",
    "- **Fair and Reliable Evaluation**\n",
    "  - Each fold represents the overall dataset distribution accurately.\n",
    "- **Improved Learning for Minority Classes**\n",
    "  - Minority classes are included in every training and validation split.\n",
    "- **Reduced Variance in Performance Scores**\n",
    "  - Leads to more stable and consistent evaluation results across folds.\n",
    "\n",

    "Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) is a special case of K-Fold Cross-Validation where the number of folds `k` is equal to the number of data points `n` in the dataset.  \n",
    "In each iteration, exactly **one data point** is used as the test set, and the remaining `n−1` data points are used for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "LOOCV follows the steps below:\n",
    "\n",
    "For a dataset with `n` data points:\n",
    "1. Select one data point as the testing set.\n",
    "2. Use the remaining `n−1` data points as the training set.\n",
    "3. Train the model on the training set.\n",
    "4. Evaluate the model on the single held-out data point and record the performance metric.\n",
    "5. Repeat this process for all `n` data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "After all iterations:\n",
    "- A total of `n` performance scores are obtained.\n",
    "- The final performance estimate is the **average of these `n` scores**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why LOOCV is Important\n",
    "**Very Low Bias**  \n",
    "Since almost the entire dataset (`n−1` samples) is used for training in each iteration, the trained model closely resembles a model trained on the full dataset. This leads to a very low-bias performance estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deterministic Evaluation**  \n",
    "LOOCV produces the same result every time it is run on the same dataset, as there is only one possible way to leave out each data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Effective for Small Datasets**  \n",
    "When the dataset is very small, LOOCV allows maximum use of available data for training in each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Consider LOOCV\n",
    "\n",
    "LOOCV is generally used in limited scenarios due to its high computational cost:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Very small datasets where training `n` models is feasible\n",
    "- Theoretical analysis of model behavior and stability\n",
    "- Certain linear models where LOOCV computation can be optimized\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison with K-Fold Cross-Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "LOOCV can be viewed as K-Fold Cross-Validation with `k = n`, but with important trade-offs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bias:** Lower bias than K-Fold (for `k < n`)\n",
    "- **Variance:** Often higher variance than K-Fold\n",
    "- **Computation:** Significantly more computationally expensive than K-Fold (e.g., `k = 5` or `k = 10`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Recommendation**: In most real-world applications, **K-Fold Cross-Validation with `k = 5` or `k = 10`** is preferred over LOOCV due to its better balance between computational efficiency, bias, and variance."
